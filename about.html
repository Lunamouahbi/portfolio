      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Luna Mouahbi, and I am an 18-year-old student currently pursuing a degree in Creative Technology at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
        With a passion for innovation and problem-solving, I am exploring the intersection of technology and creativity to design impactful solutions
        for modern challenges. Through my studies, I aim to develop both technical expertise and creative thinking, equipping me to contribute 
        to meaningful and forward-thinking projects.
      </p>

      <h2>My Passion for Technology</h2>
      <p>
        I have a strong interest in the intersection of computer science and electrical engineering, where software meets hardware to create
        innovative and practical solutions. I enjoy working on projects that bring these two fields together, whether it’s building systems,
        experimenting with circuits, or programming embedded devices. Through hands-on experience, I am deepening my understanding of how 
        technology works from the inside out, and I’m excited to continue exploring how data, algorithms, and electronics can be combined to solve real-world problems.
