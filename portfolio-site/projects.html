        <h2>Interactive Intersection Model</h2>
        <p>
          During my studies, I worked on several innovative projects. One of my first projects was an
          interactive intersection model. This model was built using Arduino, various 3D-printed components, and high-quality
          laser-cut wood. It presents a realistic traffic intersection with functioning traffic lights.

        <h2>App for the Rijksmuseum</h2>
        <p>
          Together with my project group, I developed an educational and playful app for the Rijksmuseum. This app was
          specifically designed to engage young visitors and make their museum experience more interactive and fun. Through
          games, fun facts, and scavenger hunts, children are guided through the museum’s collections in an entertaining way.
          The app is tailored to the world of children and aligns with educational learning goals.
